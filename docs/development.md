# Development

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests           # the test suite
tools/render_popup.sh /tmp/popup.png            # screenshot of the repo's popup (offscreen), QML messages in /tmp/popup.log
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet -u package       # reinstall after changes
plasmawindowed org.wzaielamri.talpyden      # run the installed widget in a window
```

GNOME extension:

```bash
gjs -m gnome/tests/test_logic.js                # its logic (no GNOME Shell needed)
gnome/build.sh                                  # build it into gnome/build/ (zip for gnome-extensions install)
tools/gnome/shell.sh /tmp/gnome                 # run it in a headless GNOME Shell (Ubuntu 26.04, podman) with made-up data, screenshots in /tmp/gnome
tools/gnome/shell.sh /tmp/gnome tools/gnome/steps-actions.sh   # jumping, notifications, settings, turning it off and on
```

VS Code extension (in `vscode/`; [In VS Code](vscode.md#development) says more):

```bash
cd vscode && npm ci                             # once
npm run check && npm test                       # type check, its tests
npm run package                                 # build talpy-den-<version>.vsix
```

```

The tests build Claude Code's files (sessions, background jobs, transcripts, shared-chat links, a switched `~/.claude` link) in temporary folders. `tests/test_remote.py` drives the SSH code through a stand-in `ssh` that runs the command locally.

**Releases:** the Plasma widget, the GNOME extension and the VS Code extension share one version. Raise it in `package/metadata.json`, `gnome/extension/metadata.json` and `vscode/package.json`, add a `## <version>` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` and `vscode/CHANGELOG.md`, commit, then push a tag (`git tag v<version> && git push origin main v<version>`). The release workflow checks, tests and builds all three and publishes them with those entries as the notes.

**Nothing private:** `tools/check_public.py` refuses commits with tokens, keys, IP addresses, emails, home folders or anything naming the machine it runs on or its SSH hosts (CI runs it on every file and the whole history). Turn it on once per clone with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

**Contributing:** issues and pull requests are welcome. Please run the tests, and check QML changes with `tools/render_popup.sh`. Keep `talpy_den.py` and `sharing.py` compatible with Python 3.7, because they also run on SSH hosts (a test checks this).
