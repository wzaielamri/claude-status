# On GNOME

The same dashboard as a GNOME Shell extension: Talpy in the top bar, the popup with your accounts, chats, plan usage, SSH hosts, notifications and pets, and its **Recap** tab. It uses the same scripts as Talpy Den on Plasma.

**Requirements:** GNOME Shell 49 or 50 (Ubuntu 26.04 LTS has 50), or 43 or 44 (Debian 12; [see below](#gnome-shell-43-and-44)), python3, jq (`sudo apt install jq`); zenity for *Choose folder…* (Ubuntu has it).

**Install:** `./install.sh` (it picks GNOME by itself in a GNOME session; `--gnome` to be sure), then log out and back in: GNOME loads new extension code only at login. Settings: the gear at the right end of the popup's top row. Update the same way (`git pull`, `./install.sh`, log out and in); `./install.sh --uninstall` removes it.

**What's different from Plasma:**

- Not on GNOME yet: **Continue on …**, **Go on at …** and **Keep going** (↻) for a chat a usage limit stopped, the usage cap, Claude's recaps and permission modes, starting a chat with a task or in the background, queued tasks, finding a chat, the ☆ on a chat that's open (star it under **Recent chats**), plans and memories (so nor **★ Starred plans**, nor hiding or deleting those), **⚠ Same files**, the chat pane (replying, dictating, answering permission prompts and Claude's questions, with or without the keyboard answers, the review). Nor are the **Projects** tab (a project in the Recap's *Where Claude worked* unfolds its chats instead), the Focus view (the filter button), changes showing the moment they happen and *Live mode* (GNOME checks every few seconds instead), and in the Recap the Tokens tile, *Chat by chat* (the Day view's lane per chat), the share button's picture and the Monday recap. Nor are the share button on an SSH host's chats, **Log in…** for an SSH host that wants a password, and the *Phone* and *Plan usage on SSH hosts* settings (an account on this computer and on a host shows its plan usage once, where it's listed first, with the newest numbers: the setting's default).
- Jumping to a chat brings its window to the front. Konsole and tmux also switch to the right tab or pane; in Ptyxis and GNOME Terminal the window comes up, but not the tab. New chats open in your default terminal (`xdg-terminal-exec`, else Ptyxis, GNOME Terminal or Console).
- You can't pick the pets up, give the big Talpy a cookie or play a game with him (they do everything else, with the same Talpy as on Plasma). With *Reduce Animation* on (Settings → Accessibility) they stay calm: the big Talpy doesn't dig about his stage, a pet whose spot moved is just there, and the light and the night's stars don't pulse or twinkle.
- The top-bar icon doesn't blink or pulse (Plasma's *Icon* setting); its badge counts the chats that need you in red, else the turns that finished since you last opened the popup in green.
- Hiding and deleting are for chats: the × on a finished chat hides it (**Hide this chat**), and **Show Hidden Chats Again (N)** in the menu at the bottom of the popup brings them back (an SSH host's: the eye button next to its name). The trash button beside the × (and on **Recent chats**) deletes a chat to the Trash after a question that says what goes and on which accounts; an SSH host's goes to that host's Trash. A chat's buttons also show while its name or one of them has the keyboard's focus.
- The menu at the bottom of the popup replaces the right-click menu; a middle click on the icon refreshes.
- Working chats are blue rather than your accent color (Ubuntu's orange would look like "needs you").
- Sounds come from your GNOME sound theme and stay quiet with Do Not Disturb.
- The shortcut to the chat that needs you is **Super+Shift+C** (change it in the settings).
- GNOME turns extensions off while the screen is locked, so nothing new notifies then (the notifications already in the tray stay); when you're back after 5 minutes or more, the summary comes as soon as the chats have been checked. After a shorter lock (or with the summary off), the first check notifies what changed meanwhile.

**Tested** in a headless GNOME Shell 50.1 on Ubuntu 26.04 (`tools/gnome/shell.sh`: the popup, jumping, notifications, settings, pets, install and uninstall), not yet on a physical Ubuntu desktop.

<a id="gnome-shell-43-and-44"></a>**GNOME Shell 43 and 44** (e.g. Debian 12) load extensions the older way. On them `./install.sh` builds a converted copy (`gnome/build.sh --gnome43`, which runs `gnome/gnome43/port43.py`): the same code with GNOME 43's imports, and small stand-ins (`gnome/gnome43/compat43*.js`) for the newer APIs it uses. If an update to the extension uses an API the converter doesn't know yet, the build stops and says which one. Tested in a headless GNOME Shell 43.9 on Debian 12. GNOME Shell 45 to 48 aren't supported.

**Troubleshooting:** messages go to GNOME's log: `journalctl --user -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`. If clicking a chat doesn't bring it up, check that the extension is enabled (`gnome-extensions info talpy-den@wzaielamri.github.io`): it's the extension that raises windows.
