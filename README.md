# Talpy Den

**Every Claude Code chat you have running, at a glance: in your KDE Plasma or GNOME panel, and in VS Code.**

Which chats are working, which need you and how much of your plan is left,
across all your accounts and SSH hosts, one click away.
And Talpy, a pet that acts out what each chat is doing.

## What it does

- **Every chat in one place:** terminal chats, background jobs and VS Code's Claude tabs, on this computer and your SSH hosts, per Claude account: which need you (and for what), which work (and on what), which are done, and each account's plan usage with where your pace leads.
- **Act without switching:** jump to a chat's terminal or VS Code tab, or chat with it right from the panel: reply, answer its permission prompts and questions, see what it changed and undo it.
- **Start chats** in a terminal, in VS Code or in the background, with a task, later, or once a usage limit resets; a chat a limit stopped can keep going by itself.
- **Find and reuse:** any chat by its words, recent chats, plans and memories; continue a chat on another account when one hits its limit; hide what you don't need, or delete it to the Trash.
- **Recap and Permissions:** your day, week or everything with Claude (time, tokens, what it would cost at API prices, what would use less of your plan), and every permission you gave, to revoke.
- **Notifications** when a chat needs you or finishes, one summary when you come back, and to your phone if you like.

Everything it does: [Features](docs/features.md).

## Get it

**KDE Plasma 6:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wzaielamri/talpy-den.git && cd talpy-den && ./install.sh
```

Then right-click your panel → **Add Widgets…** and add **Talpy Den**. It needs Claude Code, python3 and jq; `install.sh` also adds the small status-line snippet that plan usage comes from ([details](docs/install.md)).

**GNOME Shell 49 or newer, or 43 and 44 (Debian 12):** the same `./install.sh` (in a GNOME session it installs the GNOME extension), then log out and back in. [What's different on GNOME](docs/gnome.md).

**VS Code:** download `talpy-den-<version>.vsix` from the [latest release](https://github.com/wzaielamri/talpy-den/releases/latest), then `code --install-extension talpy-den-<version>.vsix`. It needs Python 3.7+ and works on its own or next to Talpy Den on Plasma or GNOME, also in Remote-SSH windows: see [In VS Code](docs/vscode.md).

Each release also has the Plasma widget as a `.plasmoid` and the GNOME extension as a `.zip`. To update: `git pull && ./install.sh` (VS Code: the newer release's `.vsix`).

## About this project

I built Talpy Den to make my own day-to-day work with Claude Code easier. With several chats running across different profiles and machines, I wanted one glance at the panel to tell me which chats need me and how much of my plan I've used. I'm sharing it in case it's useful to others.

### Not affiliated with Anthropic

This is an independent, personal project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by or otherwise connected to Anthropic, PBC, and building it does not make me a representative of Anthropic in any way. "Claude" and "Claude Code" are trademarks of Anthropic, PBC; they appear here only to describe what Talpy Den works with.

Talpy Den only reads files that Claude Code writes on your own computer, and changes them only when you ask it to: when you share a chat between your accounts, delete a chat, a plan or a memory (to the Trash), add, remove or pick the default account, allow or revoke a permission, undo or commit a chat's changes from its review, or turn on live mode or answering permission prompts from Talpy Den (a hook in Claude's settings). It does not call any Anthropic API itself, and it sends no data anywhere: plan usage that's old while a chat works (in VS Code's Claude Code panel, which runs no status line) is fetched by Claude Code's own `/usage` (`claude -p /usage`), logging in and out is Claude Code's own command, and dictation runs on your computer ([Privacy](docs/privacy.md) has the details). The *Open Usage Page on claude.ai* menu entry just opens that page in your browser.

### AI-assisted development

The code, tests and documentation in this repository were largely generated with an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, using Anthropic's Claude models) under my direction. I defined what Talpy Den should do, made the design decisions, and reviewed and tested the result on my own machine (Fedora, KDE Plasma 6).
